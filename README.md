# codeMusings
Experiment with language features, explore algorithms and data structures, performance test code. This way I can come back and visit my own examples later on when I forget what I figured out.


None of the algorithms or data structures in this repo are meant be complete. These exist just to refresh, understand, or explore concepts and aspects of data structures and algorithms.
